# HEQKD_DEMO

This is a GUI app in development that does live quantum key distribution between two systems connected to detectors. It does sifting, parameter estimation, error correction (PARTIAL), and privacy amplification (TODO)


To operate, run `python HEQKDApp.py <NAME>`, where `NAME` is either Alice or Bob. You need to set the IPs for the Alice and Bob machines in the main python file before this will work.
